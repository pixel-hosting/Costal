      <label>Reason for Blacklisting:</label>
      <p>
        The Discord server <strong>"Coastal"</strong>, owned by user <strong>leoholidayinn2</strong>, has been officially blacklisted as of <strong>May 10th, 2025</strong>, following a series of actions that we consider a violation of trust, professionalism, and community expectations in relation to inter-server partnerships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, the partnership was initiated by Coastal's administration team, who approached our server with interest in establishing a mutual partnership. After reviewing their request and server content, we agreed to the partnership under the good faith assumption that both sides would adhere to basic standards of communication, clarity, and transparency—especially as it pertained to partnership rules, expectations, and mutual support.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, shortly after the partnership was established, the Coastal team abruptly terminated the agreement. When questioned, they failed to provide a clear or justifiable reason for their decision. This was particularly problematic given that they were the ones who initiated the partnership process. Their justification for the termination was vague, unsubstantiated, and in direct contradiction to the mutual trust that was expected from both parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, they claimed that our server had violated their “partnership rules,” yet upon review and discussion, it became clear that no such rules had ever been shared, documented, or made publicly visible within their server. When pressed on this matter, their staff could not reference or produce any written rules or criteria we allegedly violated. This indicates either a deliberate misrepresentation of their expectations or an absence of organized internal policy regarding partnerships.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of transparency, professional courtesy, and consistent communication exhibited by Coastal’s team creates a concerning precedent for future interactions—not only with our community but potentially with others in the wider Discord ecosystem. Their behavior raises red flags regarding how they treat agreements and partners, especially when discrepancies arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result of this incident, and after reviewing relevant evidence including direct messages, server announcements, and internal discussions, we have decided to blacklist the Coastal Discord server. We recommend that other communities approach partnerships with them cautiously or reconsider entirely.
